## Overview
MongoCapsule is a very thin wrapper around MongoEngine built for your happiness. It encapsulates MongoEngine attributes under a single namespace and hence allows explicit declaration without context switches.

In addition to that, MongoCapsule adds pagination support to all the query results.

MongoEngine is a great ORM for using MongoDB in any Python project. However, since MongoEngine works in "contexts", using multiple databases requires trickery such as `db_alias` and `switch_db`. MongoCapsule solves this by attaching references to MongoEngine attributes to itself.


## Quickstart

If you are familiar with MongoEngine, you can use MongoCapsule already! Create the database object and use it to define your document and fields.

```python
from mongocapsule import MongoCapsule

db = MongoCapsule('test_db')

class Fruits(db.Document):
    name = db.StringField()
```

Refer to [MongoEngine Docs](http://docs.mongoengine.org/index.html) for details.

## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
    pip install mongocapsule
```

Or clone the repo:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prashnts/mongocapsule.git
    python setup.py install
```

## Additional API

MongoCapsule adds Pagination support to the MongoEngine `QuerySet` object. It returns 10 objects per page, however, this can be changed.

```python

# Obtain nth Page of any arbitrary query:

query_results = Document.objects(...).sort(...)

result_page = query_results.page(2)     # Obtain second page

total_pages = query_results.page_count

# Update number of items returned per page:

db.QuerySet.set_page_limit(20)

```

## Rant
I wrote this module because the examples in official MongoEngine documentation encourages using `from mongoengine import *` which not only pollutes the local namespace, but makes class definitions implicit. Of course, cherrypicked imports are possible, however that requires a lot of extra imports in each files.

The biggest problem, however, comes when you're using multiple databases or hosts -- in those cases, you need to use context switches or ugly `meta` attributes in the declaration.
